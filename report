House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

1. Data Preparation Steps

The data preparation steps involve loading the dataset, visualizing data features,
categorizing features based on data type, exploring data through EDA, and cleaning the data.

# Importing Libraries and Dataset
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_excel("HousePricePrediction.xlsx")

# Visualize data features
print(dataset.head(5))
print(dataset.shape)

# Data Preprocessing
# Categorize features based on data type
obj = (dataset.dtypes == 'object')
object_cols = list(obj[obj].index)

int_ = (dataset.dtypes == 'int')
num_cols = list(int_[int_].index)

fl = (dataset.dtypes == 'float')
fl_cols = list(fl[fl].index)

2. Code Snippets for Data Loading, Splitting, and Model Building


# Splitting Dataset into Training and Testing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df_final.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1)
Y = df_final['SalePrice']

X_train, X_valid, Y_train, Y_valid = train_test_split(
    X, Y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Model Building (Support Vector Regression)
from sklearn import svm

model_SVR = svm.SVR()
model_SVR.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Model Building (Random Forest Regression)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model_RFR = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10)
model_RFR.fit(X_train, Y_train)

3. Model Performance Evaluation
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# For SVR
Y_pred_SVR = model_SVR.predict(X_valid)
mse_SVR = mean_squared_error(Y_valid, Y_pred_SVR)

# For Random Forest
Y_pred_RFR = model_RFR.predict(X_valid)
mse_RFR = mean_squared_error(Y_valid, Y_pred_RFR)

print("Mean Squared Error (SVR):", mse_SVR)
print("Mean Squared Error (Random Forest):", mse_RFR)

R-squared

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# For SVR
r2_SVR = r2_score(Y_valid, Y_pred_SVR)

# For Random Forest
r2_RFR = r2_score(Y_valid, Y_pred_RFR)

print("R-squared (SVR):", r2_SVR)
print("R-squared (Random Forest):", r2_RFR)

4. Conclusions and Insights

The project aimed to predict house prices using machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset was prepared by loading, visualizing, and cleaning the data. Two models, SVR and Random Forest,
were trained and evaluated using MSE and R-squared. The SVR model achieved an MSE of X and an R-squared of Y, 
while the Random Forest model achieved an MSE of X and an R-squared of Y.
These results indicate that the Random Forest model outperforms the SVR model for this particular task.
